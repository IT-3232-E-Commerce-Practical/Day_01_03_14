# Java Programs Repository

## Description
This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as loops, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data structures. The programs include basic tasks, class implementations, and advanced concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Programs Included

### 1. Basic Java Programs
- **Print a message**: A simple program that prints a message to the console.
- **Print numbers from 1 to 10**: Uses a loop to print numbers sequentially.
- **Print numbers in reverse**: Prints numbers in descending order.
- **Print odd numbers from 1 to 20**: Displays only odd numbers in a given range.
- **Reverse the left and right numbers**: Accepts an input number and reverses its left and right halves using a loop.

### 2. Student Class Implementation
- A `Student` class is created with attributes like `name` and `marks`.
- Five `Student` objects are stored in a data structure (e.g., ArrayList).
- The program calculates and prints the average marks of the students.

### 3. Library System
- Implements a library system with different types of books:
  - **Printed Books**
  - **E-Books**
  - **Audiobooks**
- Uses **inheritance** to create book categories.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** to handle different book types.
- Implements **encapsulation** to protect book data.

### 4. Retail Store Management System
- A retail store that manages multiple products such as:
  - Fruits
  - Vegetables
  - Grocery items
- Features include:
  - Adding new products
  - Editing existing products
  - Deleting products
  - Displaying available products with name, price, and quantity
